RemainInMotion
==============

Continuation of JAKJ's excellent block-moving mod. I plan to update and expand mod integration and create a functional hardcore mode, and port everything to new Minecraft versions.

Pre-compiled binaries are available at the following URL: https://github.com/planetguy32/RemainInMotion/releases

(The name is a pun on Newton's first law - a Redstone in Motion tends to Remain in Motion.)

### There is info on the GitHub wiki section for each carriage. (The little book icon)
